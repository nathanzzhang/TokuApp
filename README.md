## Tōku

#### 
Communication and cultural understanding are both fundamental qualities in modern society, which is why we were inspired to create Tōku. Tōku is a language-learning, partner-finding app where people from all around the world can connect with each other while practicing new languages. 

#### About the Team
Sky Jung, Jeffrey Mun, and Anna Katherine Zhao are seniors at Troy High School in Fullerton. None of them actually live in Fullerton, but that's okay! They are doing their very best.
